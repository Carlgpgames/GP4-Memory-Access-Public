# GP4 Memory Access

GP4 Memory Access is a tool for legendary Geoff Crammond’s Grand Prix 4, re-leased by Infogrames in 2002. It is developed and designed by Carl_gpgames, Öggo and ZaZ for modifying and interacting with Grand Prix 4 game memory. This tool allows you to edit memory offsets, apply patches and inject new code (DLLs), all while ensuring compatibility with GPxPatch (by SDI) and GP4 Tweaker (by Madman271). This tool does not make modifications to any of your files (such as gp4.exe). Whatever it does, happens in memory only. 

Please refer to the Documentation for more information.
